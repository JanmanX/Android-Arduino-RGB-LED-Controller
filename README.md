Android-Arduino RGB LED Controller
==================================

(NOT TESTED WITH A STRIP YET, ONLY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ANDROID-ARDUINO TESTED!)

Android app and Arduino program for controlling a RGB LED strip remotely.

Inspired from [Jerome Bernard Blog](http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2013/01/12/rgb-led-strip-controlled-by-an-arduino)
, DEFINITELLY check it out!


Thanks to Pascal Cans and Justin Warner for their Android Color Picker, used in
the Android app. Check out it out [here](https://github.com/yukuku/ambilwarna).
(I could not import their module into the project with Android Studio, so I
hand-copied every file into my project. Its bad :S )


TODO
====
- User input for IP and PORT
- Display current status of Arduino in the App
- Improve UI (Better color schemes, color for SeekBars)
